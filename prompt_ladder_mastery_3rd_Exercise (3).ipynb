These layers are where the network performs its complex computations and extracts increasingly abstract features from the data. A network with many hidden layers is called a **Deep Neural Network**, which is the basis of \"Deep Learning.\"\n",
            "3.  **Output Layer:** This layer produces the final result of the network. The number of neurons here depends on the task (e.g., one neuron for a yes/no prediction, multiple neurons for classifying an image into one of several categories).\n",

            "3.  **Adjust Weights (Backpropagation):** This is where **Backpropagation** comes in. The error is \"propagated backward\" through the network, from the output layer to the input layer. During this process, the network calculates how much each individual weight and bias contributed to the overall error. It essentially figures out who was \"most responsible\" for the mistake.\n",
            "4.  **Optimization (Gradient Descent):** Based on these calculated contributions (called \"gradients\"), an **Optimizer** (like Gradient Descent) adjusts the weights and biases slightly. The goal is to nudge these values in a direction that would *reduce* the loss next time. Think of it like a hiker trying to get down a hill in a fog – they take small steps in the steepest downward direction.\n",
            "5.  **Iterate:** This entire process (forward propagation, calculating loss, backpropagation, updating weights) is repeated thousands or millions of times, with different batches of data.

            "    *   Then, they apply a \"threshold\" or a \"squashing function.\" If the combined \"score\" is high enough, they \"speak up\" strongly (e.g., \"This restaurant is a definite hit on taste!\"). If it's low, they remain quiet or offer a mild opinion. This thresholding process is called the **activation function**. It determines if a neuron \"fires\" or passes information onward.\n",

            "4.  **Adjusting the Weights (Backpropagation):** This is the crucial part. The network figures out *which critics were wrong* and *how much* their weights and biases contributed to the error. It then slightly adjusts those weights and biases to make the prediction more accurate next time. This process of error correction, propagating backward through the network, is called **backpropagation**.\n",
            "5.  **Iteration:** You repeat this process *thousands or millions of times* with all your training data. Each time, the weights and biases are slightly adjusted, slowly making the network \"smarter\" and its predictions more accurate. It's like a sculptor refining their work, gradually chipping away until the perfect form emerges.\n",

            "2.  **Adaptability:** Once trained, they can generalize to new, unseen data, making predictions on information they haven't encountered before.\n",

            "    *   **Weight & Bias Update (Optimization):** An **optimizer** (like Gradient Descent) uses these gradients to adjust the weights and biases. The goal is to slightly change each weight and bias in a direction that will reduce the loss for the next forward pass.\n",

            "Let's use our cat/dog example to illustrate the process:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Problem:** Build a neural network that can classify an image as either a \"cat\" or a \"dog.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Data Preparation:**\n",
            "    *   You gather a large dataset of images, each accurately labeled as either \"cat\" or \"dog.\"\n",
            "    *   Each image is converted into a numerical format. For instance, a 100x100 pixel color image would be represented by 100 * 100 * 3 (for Red, Green, Blue channels) = 30,000 numerical values.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Input Layer:**\n",
            "    *   Each of these 30,000 pixel values is fed as a separate input into a neuron in the **Input Layer** of the network.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Hidden Layers (Feature Extraction):**\n",
            "    *   **Early Hidden Layers:** Neurons in the first few hidden layers might learn to detect very simple, generic features like **edges**, **lines**, or **corners** at different orientations and locations within the image.\n",
            "    *   **Deeper Hidden Layers:** Subsequent hidden layers combine these simpler features to form increasingly complex and abstract features. They might learn to recognize shapes like **eyes**, **ears**, **snouts**, or **fur textures**. The network *discovers* these features itself, purely from the data, without being explicitly programmed. It learns which combinations of edges usually form an ear, and which combination of shapes tends to be a nose.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Output Layer (Classification):**\n",
            "    *   The final hidden layer feeds into the **Output Layer**.\n",
            "    *   In this case, the output layer might have two neurons: one representing \"cat\" and one representing \"dog.\"\n",
            "    *   Each neuron will output a probability score (e.g., if the network sees a cat image: \"cat: 0.95, dog: 0.05\"). This indicates the network's confidence in the image being a cat (95%) versus a dog (5%).\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Learning in Action (Backpropagation):**\n",
            "    *   **Initial Stage:** When you first start training, the network's weights are random. It might see a cat image and randomly guess \"dog\" with 60% probability.\n",
            "    *   **Error Calculation:** The **loss function** detects a significant error (predicted \"dog\" for a \"cat\").\n",
            "    *   **Backward Pass:** Backpropagation identifies which weights and biases contributed to this wrong prediction. It calculates the gradients for all parameters.\n",
            "    *   **Weight Adjustment:** The optimizer uses these gradients to slightly adjust all the weights and biases. It will subtly decrease the influence of connections that led to the \"dog\" prediction and increase the influence of connections that should have activated \"cat\" features.\n",
            "    *   **Iteration:** This process is repeated for thousands or millions of cat and dog images. Over time, the network gradually refines its internal features and decision boundaries. It gets better and better at recognizing the unique visual patterns that differentiate cats from dogs, minimizing its prediction errors until it can accurately classify new, unseen images.\n",
            "\n",
            "In essence, neural networks learn to create a complex internal model of the world (or at least the data you show them) by continuously adjusting their parameters based on their prediction errors.\n"
